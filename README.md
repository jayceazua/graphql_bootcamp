# GraphQL Learning

Creates fast and flexible APIs, giving clients complete control to ask for just the data they need.
Fewer HTTP requests, flexible data querying less code to manage.

- Client sending the query to the server, uses a single endpoint.
- Unlike the manual work of updating REST APIs, GraphQL self-documents.

Example:

```
query {
  hello // request what types/ field you want...
  courseInstructor
  course
}
```
